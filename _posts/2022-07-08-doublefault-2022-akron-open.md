title: "2022 Akron Open!"
date: 2022-07-08
excerpt: "THE no-holds-barred most experienced tournament player in the field, he's also played against many of his potential competitors as well.  Not only that, but the 2022 version of Benjamin is a sleeker, slimmer, and angrier version of the earlier versions, so look for his cross court shots to take him deep into the event when all is said and done!"
