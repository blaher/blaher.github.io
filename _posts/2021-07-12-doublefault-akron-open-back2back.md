excerpt: "Court One saw two of the most travelled and most veteran 3.0 tournament players of the last decade face off for the fourth time in their careers. Previously competitors, it was the NCRC captain who enjoyed the early psychological advantage. AND HOW IT SHOWED!  Benjamin ran out to the early 3-0 lead, blistering his opponent off the court with a blistering serve and countering Travis' well-known serve and volley technique with pin-point forehands."
