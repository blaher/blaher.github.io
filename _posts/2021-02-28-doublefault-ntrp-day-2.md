excerpt: "Both big ball hitters banged away from the baseline, trying to overpower their opponent with deeply placed shots that would put their rival on the defensive.  Back and forth this one went, and the crowd was in for a 3.0 treat as this 78' figurative boxing match went the distance!  Doug drew first tennis blood, taking the first set by just a point! But in the second, Benjamin rallied back, to do the same, also by just a point! Nary player was willing to give an inch, and thus, fittingly, the match was decided in yet ANOTHER tiebreak!  Huge play after huge play took play, Benjamin hitting big forehands while Doug countered with big backhands. In the end, the singles experience of Benjamin may have made the difference, for, by just two points, he emerged the victor.  But the really winners were the countless 3.0 fans in the stands who were able to witness these two tennis warriors battle it out as the Ancient Greeks no doubt intended."
