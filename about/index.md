Hello there! Nice to meet you. I have been known online as the alias of Blaher. Please, feel free to call me by Ben. Homosapien extraordinaire. CTO, investor, day trader, affiliate marketer, senior software engineer, macroeconomist, biological chemist, physicist, mathematician, analyst, philosopher, polymath, utilitarian, father, tennis player, dog whisper, human meat popsicle, or mad man; feel free to call me whatever. My family rooted itself in Stark County, OH. As a direct descendant of one of the first settlers of Stark County, Iâ€™ve made it my home for a long time. Growing up in the countryside, I moved my way back in to civilization. Entrepreneurship and intelligence have run heavy in my family's blood though, as it does in mine as well.
