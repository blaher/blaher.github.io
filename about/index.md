Hello there! Nice to meet you. I have been known online as the alias of Blaher. Please, feel free to call me by Ben. Homosapien extraordinaire. CTO, investor, day trader, affiliate marketer, senior software engineer, macroeconomist, biological chemist, physicist, mathematician, analyst, philosopher, polymath, utilitarian, father, tennis player, dog whisper, human meat popsicle, or mad man; feel free to call me whatever. My family rooted itself in Stark County, OH. As a direct descendant of one of the first settlers of Stark County, I’ve made it my home for a long time. Growing up in the countryside, I moved my way back in to civilization. Entrepreneurship and intelligence have run heavy in my family's bloodline though, as it does in mine as well.

## What does "Blaher" mean? ##
I get asked this question a lot. I use "Blaher" from everything to a domain, email, username, alias, and in other useses in my life. So to explain it, for once and for all... In short, Blaher has been my internet alias since 2003. So why did I pick that? It's a dirived modern version of "barbarian" I came up with. Let me explain first the origins of the word barbarian, for context. The word barbarian comes from the words bárbaros/barbarus in greek/latin, literally meaning "babbler" (babbler was already taken). Or one who babbles a language not of their own, and and perceivably sounding unintelligent. The Roman Empire would later identify the entire Germanic tribes as Barbarians and since my familial heritage is deeply rooted in Germany/Norden, I come from "Barbarian" blood. Since a modern alternative to "babbler" is "blah blah blah" and I needed to select an username for online community forums, I settled on "blaher" as a dirivitive little nod to my genetic history. Since the internet was in an era plagued by trolling, it was a good defense to embrace a self defamating term. Thus the usage of "Blaher" was born and has been used since.
